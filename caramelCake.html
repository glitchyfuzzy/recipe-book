    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Cake</h3>
            <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups butter</li>
            <li>5 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <h3>Icing</h3>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅔ cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch cake pans.</li>
            <li>Make cake: Place white sugar and butter into a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture in batches, alternating with milk, beating batter briefly after each addition. Add vanilla extract; beat until batter makes ribbons when falling from the beaters. Divide batter among the prepared cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make icing: Combine brown sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until brown sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Add evaporated milk and continue stirring. Bring to a gentle boil and let bubble for about 4 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid sticking. Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract into brown sugar mixture using an electric mixer until icing caramelizes and thickens to the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Spread icing onto cooled cake layers. Stack layers; ice top and sides.</li>
        </ol>
